blank-canvas
============

A Blank(ish) WordPress Theme for starting projects. SASS Based, Responsive, HTML5.

Built from the ground up, this theme was built for my own uses to have a great base to start new projects with. It's responsive by default using the KUBE CSS grid and UI elements. Some bits may have been used from other sources, possibly from Todd Motto's HTML5Blank theme. (If anybody would like code removed please get in touch.)

Feel free to use this theme for your own uses.

*NOTE: You may wish to make edits to the customisations.php file to suit.
